        "description": "Lafora Disease is an autosomal recessive genetic disease of several dog breeds characterized by accumulation of polyglucosan Lafora bodies within central nervous system neuronal soma and dendrites, leading to progressive neurological dysfunctions. Lafora bodies also accumulate in other organs where they tend to remain subclinical. Signs appear at a median age of 7â€‰years. The main presenting clinical signs are spontaneous and reflex myoclonus and seizures. Disease progression leads to other clinical signs. ",

        "description": "Otitis is common in calves and pigs but young and adults of all species are susceptible. Affected animals remain alert, strong, and responsive. When bilateral can cause a tremor resembling that seen with cerebellar disease. Organisms associated with otitis in cattle include MYCOPLASMA BOVIS, HISTOPHILUS SOMNI, PASTEURELLA, MANNHEIMIA, ARCANOBACTER PYOGENES, STREPTOCOCCUS sp., ACTINOMYCES spp. and the ear mite RAILLIETIA AURIS. Parasitic otitis caused by nematodes of the genus RHABDITIS has been reported in Brazilian and African cattle. MANNHEIMIA  HAEMOLYTICA and PASTEURELLA MULTOCIDA are common agents in sheep; MYCOPLASMA spp. in goats; in swine the agents involved include MYCOPLASMA ARIGINI, M. HYORHINIS, PASTEURELLA MULTOCIDA, ACTINOMYCES PYOGENES, STREPTOCOCCUS spp. and ACTINOBACILLUS PLEUROPNEUMONIAE.  PSOROPTES OVIS is the common ear mite of goats and sheep, OTODECTES CYNOTIS or RAILLIETIA can infest the ears of goats. There might ocular lesions due to corneal exposure secondary to facial weakness. Petrous temporal bone fracture after chronic otitis has been seen in horses and head shaking can be a clinical sign in horses. A horse developed head rubbing and discharge from the ear caused by an inflammatory polyp in the external auditory canal.",

TRICHOSTRONGYLUS, NEMATODIRUS, COOPERIA, STRONGYLOIDES, and BUNOSTOMUM are parasites of the ruminant small intestine. OESOPHAGOSTOMUM, CHABERTIA and TRICHURIS are found in the ruminant large intestine. TOXOCARA VITULORUM is common in young calves in tropical and subtropical regions. The tapeworms THYSANOSOMA and MONEZIA do not cause signs but tapeworm segments can be passed.
